# What is Snipe-IT-Label-Generator?
Part of day-to-day internal IT means tracking assets, which includes applying stickers or labels to your assets for tracking. I was sick of having to manually lookup, add, edit and crop labels for our self-hosted SnipeIT inventory/asset system- So i created Snipe-IT-Label-Generator. Using this application, you simply type in the asset tag/s you need, hit "Generate" and everything will automatically be added into a Word doc with the correct format + information!

This includes adding the tag/ID number, serial number and generating a QR code


# See it in action!
  - Input asset tag/s and then hit "Generate .DOC"
