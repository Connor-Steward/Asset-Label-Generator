# What is Snipe-IT-Label-Generator?
I was sick of having to manually lookup, add, edit and crop labels for our self-hosted SnipeIT inventory/assets system 
(See: https://snipeitapp.com/). 

Using this application, you can simply type in the asset tag/s you need and using the SnipeIT API will get the relevant info for the tag, add it into a Word mailmerge and format everything correctly for you!
