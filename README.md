# What is Snipe-IT-Label-Generator?
I was sick of having to manually lookup, add, edit and crop labels for our self-hosted SnipeIT inventory/assets system. Using this application, you can simply type in the asset tag/s you need and using the SnipeIT API it will get the relevant info for the tag, add it into a Word mailmerge and format everything correctly for you!


# See it in action!
  - Input asset tag/s and then hit "Generate .DOC"
